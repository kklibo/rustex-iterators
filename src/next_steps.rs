/// Congratulations! You finished rustex-iterators, and now have an idea of how
/// to use `Iterator`-based code in your Rust projects.
///
/// Next steps:
///
/// * Although rustex-iterators has covered most of the important ones, there are
/// lots of other methods in the `std::iter::Iterator` trait to look through. Now
/// that you understand Iterator methods better, re-skimming the list of methods
/// in the docs might give you some good ideas.
///
/// * The [`itertools`](https://crates.io/crates/itertools) crate is a very popular
/// extension of `std::iter::Iterator`. Take a look at this crate's features to see
/// more things you can do with Rust iterators.
///
/// Happy coding!

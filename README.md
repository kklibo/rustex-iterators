Rust Exercises for learning to use `std::iter::Iterator`

### Who is this for?
If you already know the basics of Rust and would like to learn more about Rust iterators, these exercises are for you.

If you're just getting started with Rust, you should definitely do the **Rustlings** exercises (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) first, and then come back and do these ones.

### What are these exercises?
Each exercise starts with a function that already succeeds at accomplishing some task. Your goal is to use `std::iter::Iterator` methods to write a more concise function that exactly matches the original function's behavior.

### Why do them?
When you're done, you will have tried roughly half of `Iterator`'s methods (it's a long list!), and you will have a sense of how concise and elegant Rust iterators can be.

### How to do these exercises
Start by reading
* The [iterator chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html) in [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
* The `std::iter` [module documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html)
* and keep the `std::iter::Iterator` [trait documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) open: you'll be looking through this a lot!

These exercises are test-driven: an exercise is complete when its tests pass. Run `cargo test` to see the next error to be fixed, or to confirm your solution.

To advance to the next level, uncomment the next module in `lib.rs`.

#### Alternative without local Rust
If you don't have Rust installed locally, you can also manually copy the exercise file contents in the `src` directory to the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021) and run them there.

### Answers
`ANSWERS.md` contains example answers for each exercise.

#### Good luck! Run `cargo test` to start.
